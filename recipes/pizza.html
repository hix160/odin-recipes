    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes, until it becomes frothy.</li>
                    <li>Add 2 cups of flour, olive oil, and salt to the yeast mixture. Stir until combined.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough comes together and is no longer sticky.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes, until smooth and elastic.</li>
                    <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
                    <p></p>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, combine the tomato sauce, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well and set aside.</li>
                    <p></p>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.</li>
                     <p></p>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal portions (for two pizzas).</li>
                    <li>On a floured surface, roll out one portion of the dough into a circle, about 12 inches in diameter. Transfer it to a piece of parchment paper for easy handling.</li>
                    <li>Spread a thin layer of the prepared sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle half of the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Add your desired toppings.</li>
                    <p></p>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If using a pizza stone, transfer the pizza (with the parchment paper) onto the preheated stone. If not, place the pizza on a baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
                    <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
                    <p></p>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Repeat for Second Pizza:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Repeat steps 4 and 5 with the second portion of dough and remaining ingredients.</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>

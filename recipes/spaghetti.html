    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is a traditional Italian pasta dish from Naples. 
        The name translates to "spaghetti with garlic and oil." 
        It's made by lightly sautéing sliced garlic in olive oil, 
        sometimes with the addition of red pepper flakes for a bit of heat, 
        and then tossing with cooked spaghetti. The result is a flavorful, 
        aromatic, and satisfying dish that can be made in under 20 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook the Spaghetti:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
                    <li>Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente (firm to the bite).</li>
                    <li>Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the spaghetti.</li>
                    <p></p>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Garlic and Oil:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the sliced garlic and sauté until it becomes golden brown and fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Be careful not to burn the garlic as it can become bitter.</li>
                    <li>If using, add the red pepper flakes and sauté for another 30 seconds.</li>
                    <p></p>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Combine Pasta and Sauce:</strong></li>
                <ul>

                    <li>Toss the pasta well to coat it in the oil and garlic.</li>
                    <li>If the pasta seems dry, add a little bit of the reserved pasta cooking water to loosen it up.</li>
                    <li>Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
                    <p></p>
                </ul>

                    <li>Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.</li>
